# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an aesthetic home page with a call-to-action button that entices users to explore the resume tailoring feature.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new Home page component with visually appealing design featuring compelling copy about AI-powered resume tailoring
- Add a prominent "Tailor Resume" call-to-action button that navigates to the tailoring interface
- Update App.tsx routing to show the home page by default at the root route
- Maintain the existing ink/paper aesthetic and OKLCH color system

**User-visible outcome:** Users land on an attractive home page that explains the resume tailoring benefits and provides a clear button to access the tailoring tool.
